          <h3>Measure Data Cleaner</h3>
          <p>While interning at Autoliv, I developed a web application using the "shiny" package 
             in R.  The purpose of the application is to clean data that is received from a specific test 
             that is often performed on the sensors we work with.  I first wrote a script to automate this, 
             but I gave the program a user interface to make it easier for others to use.  The names of the csv 
             files that are used as input for the program are denoted by "MeasData_####", hence why I called 
             the application Measure Data Cleaner.</p>

          <h3>Auto Loan Calculator</h3>
          <p>I designed an auto loan calculator using the "shiny" package for R once again.  I created this 
             for a friend who sells cars, and it served as useful practice for me as well.</p>

          <h3>Block Hop</h3>
          <p>Block Hop is a 2D platformer game that I programmed using Java.  I followed a youtube series 
             taught by RealTutsGML which showed how to develop this type of game using Java.  I have had some formal class 
             experience where we used Java, but this tutorial helped me out a lot and there is still lots of room 
             to add ones own creative touch by the end of the series.</p>
