          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>I graduated from UMASS Amherst in the spring of 2017 with a BS in Mathematics.  Some of the classes I have
             taken include probability and statistics, data structures, algorithms, regression analysis, and graph theory.
             One of my most memorable class projects was during regression analysis when I was assigned to a group that
             was asked to analyze a dataset from the 1986 MLB season and develop a regression model to predict players
             salaries based on the numbers they put up.

          <h3>Experience</h3>
          <p>Currently, this is my second summer interning at Autoliv and it has been a fulfilling experience.  
             Autoliv is part of the automotive industry and designs radars that are placed into cars which will soon
             lead to self driving cars.  My main function as an intern is to perform statistical analysis on data and produce 
             data visualizations using R and Excel.  Usually it starts with designing an experiment, performing tests, and then
             looking at the data to see what our experiments have shown.</p>

          <h3>Interests</h3>
          <p>Some of my interests include coding with Java and R to develop applications both for work and for personal use.  
             I also enjoy working on this website which includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and I intend to add a PHP script       
             to handle some data on the backend.  I also keep a close eye on the stock market but would only consider myself
             a novice investor.  As of right now, my investment strategy is not the most structured or organized, I'm
             sticking to the most basic strategy, buy low sell high!</p>

          <h3>Measure Data Cleaner</h3>
          <p>While interning at Autoliv, I developed a web application using the "shiny" package 
             in R.  The purpose of the application is to clean data that is received from a specific test 
             that is often performed on the sensors we work with.  I first wrote a script to automate this, 
             but I gave the program a user interface to make it easier for others to use.  The names of the csv 
             files that are used as input for the program are denoted by "MeasData_####", hence why I called 
             the application Measure Data Cleaner.</p>

          <h3>Auto Loan Calculator</h3>
          <p>I designed an auto loan calculator using the "shiny" package for R once again.  I created this 
             for a friend who sells cars, and it served as useful practice for me as well.</p>

          <h3>Block Hop</h3>
          <p>Block Hop is a 2D platformer game that I programmed using Java.  I followed a youtube series 
             taught by RealTutsGML which showed how to develop this type of game using Java.  I have had some formal class 
             experience where we used Java, but this tutorial helped me out a lot and there is still lots of room 
             to add ones own creative touch by the end of the series.</p>
