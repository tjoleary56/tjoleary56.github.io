  <p>  First off, thank you for visiting my website!  Now, I will inform you a little about myself, where do I start, well,
       I'm 21 years old and will be a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the fall of 2016.
         I'm studying Mathematics and Computer Science, with Mathematics being my major and Computer Science being my minor.
         Currently, as I'm developing this website, it is the summer of 2016.  This is the first summer that I have had an internship,
          and it has been a fulfilling experience for me thus far.  So, there is the brief summary of where I'm at in life. </p>
