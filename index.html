       <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p>  First off, thank you for visiting my website!  Now, I will inform you a little about myself, where do I start, well,
       I'm 21 years old and will be a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the fall of 2016.
         I'm studying Mathematics and Computer Science, with Mathematics being my major and Computer Science being my minor.
         Currently, as I'm developing this website, it is the summer of 2016.  This is the first summer that I have had internship,
          and it has been a fulfilling experience for me thus far.  So, there is the brief summary of where I'm at in life.
           </p>
           
           <h3>My Internship</h3>
           <p>  I work as a technical intern at Autoliv in Lowell, MA where I mainly work with data analysis.  When I began the job,
           I was nervous and didn't know what to expect, but not before long I was settled in and started to understand how things
            go in my field of work.  Autoliv is an automotive company with many facilites that focus on creating and improving
            safety features for vehicles, at my specific location we focus on the development of radars that go into vehicles.
              I have been working with Microsoft Excel and the statistical computing language, R.  Currently, I'm developing a
               couple of web apps using an R package called 'shiny' and it has been a great learning experience.  
               I was not familiar with R before starting my internship, but I feel that I have been learning more than I expected
                with this language.  I have taken no formal class that tought me how to use R, so I have been learning it on my own
                 and I'm excited to see what I can do with it by the end of my internship.</p>
                 
                 <h3>Projects</h3>
                 <p>I'm developing two web apps using R and a web game using Java.</p>
                 
                 <p>1)  One of the web apps is used to take in an excel
                 file where the user is then given optins on how they want to filter their data.  The user is allowed to choose
                  which column they would like their data to be filtered by.  The user is given three text boxes where one can type in 
                  strings of what they would like their data to be filtered by.  Then a download button can be pressed to export an excel
                  workbook containing a sheet with their original data, and up to three other sheets with their filtered data.</p>
                  
                   <p>2)  The other web app takes in an excel file and allows the user to choose which columns they would
                    like to plot as their x and y variables.  There are options for five different plot types, color types, and
                     a text box to type in a title for the plot.</p>
                     
                     <p>3)  My web game is based on the tutorial videos from RealTutsGML on youtube.  It is a platformer game
                      in its infancy and I plan to create about 15 - 20 levels of varying difficulty for the game.</p>
                      
                      <p>When I'm done with my projects I will either include them on my website or give links to them.  
                      I plan to realease initial fully functioning versions and update them with added features.</p>
